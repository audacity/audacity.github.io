# AGENTS

- Use Conventional Commits for commit messages (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`).
- Keep changes minimal and scoped to the request.
- Use Bun commands by default (`bun install`, `bun run ...`, `bunx ...`).
- Keep docs/tooling phrasing implementation-agnostic where possible.
- Don’t add npm-specific lockfile or workflow changes unless explicitly requested.
- Validate changes with Playwright MCP where available.
