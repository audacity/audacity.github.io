Audacity 3.7 has been released!

It features everyone's favorite "bug fixes and performance improvements". See the [full changelog](https://support.audacityteam.org/additional-resources/changelog/audacity-3.7) for details.

Other than that ­– there’s nothing exciting to see here. Which in itself is exciting! The reason for this very thin release is that we’ve focused most of our attention towards **Audacity 4.0** instead! Audacity 4 will feature a complete remake of the UI and is still quite some ways out. We’ll update you on scope and progress on that over the coming months.

In the meantime: Check out the [Muse Hub](https://www.musehub.com/plugins) for some cool plugins.
