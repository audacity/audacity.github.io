## Major changes in Audacity 3.6
### Master effects
Audacity now features master effects. Master effects are effects which apply to the entire project at once. More information can be found at [Audacity Support: Using master effects & realtime effects](https://support.audacityteam.org/audio-editing/using-realtime-effects).

### New compressor and limiter
A new compressor and limiter has been added, replacing the previous versions. A gain reduction history has been added to these effects when they're used as a realtime effect. 

Factory Presets suitable for a wide range of use cases for these effects have been provided by Vladislav Isaev and Marek Iwaszkiewicz, available via the Presets & Settings button.

### New themes
Audacity now features new and improved dark and light themes. You can switch between themes via Preferences -> Interface. The theme previously used still is around as the Classic theme, and themes even older than that can be optionally [installed as custom themes](https://support.audacityteam.org/basics/customizing-audacity/using-themes#installing-custom-themes).

Updated instructions on creating custom themes can be found [here](https://audacity.gitbook.io/dev/scripting/creating-custom-themes).

### Increased performance
Audacity is now quite a bit snappier than before, especially when working on larger projects and on larger screens.
