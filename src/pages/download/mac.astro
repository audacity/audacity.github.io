  <h3>About these downloads</h3>
  <h4 class="mt-4 md:mt-8">System requirements</h4>
  <p class="mt-2">
    Audacity is tested on macOS 14 & 15, and may also work on any OS X version
    released after and including OS X 10.9 Mavericks. Both Intel (x86_64) and
    Apple Silicon (ARM 64) versions are available, as well as a universal
    binary. There are no specific CPU or GPU requirements.</p>
    <p class="mt-2">
    Mac OS X 10.14 and earlier don't support the universal dmg. Use the Intel-only dmg instead.</p>
    <p class="mt-2">
    <strong>Note:</strong> Audacity requires fast, uninterrupted access to a hard
    drive or SSD to operate. Network storage, consumer-grade external hard drives
    or USB thumbdrives may be unreliable.
