# Accessibility Statement – Audacity

**Audacity** is committed to ensuring digital accessibility for people with disabilities. We are continually improving the user experience for everyone and applying the relevant accessibility standards.

## Compliance Status

The Audacity desktop application is **partially compliant** with EN 301 549 as it applies to desktop software (clauses 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12). The application satisfies all applicable **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** criteria, with remaining gaps limited to a subset of **Level AAA** requirements.

**Partial compliance** means that most accessibility requirements are met, but with some exceptions, and that the necessary measures are to be taken in order to reach full compliance.

## Non-accessible Content

The content listed below is non-accessible in Audacity 3.7 and will be addressed with the release of Audacity 4.0 in Q2 2026

1. **Application functionality is only partially accessible via keyboard** – issue will be fixed in Audacity 4.0 by Q2 2026.
