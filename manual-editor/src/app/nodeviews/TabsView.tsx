/**
 * Node view for the `tabs` block node (maps to the `Tabs` mdast component;
 * see `registry.ts`). Renders one clickable header per child `tab`, showing
 * its `label` attr (falling back to "Tab N"), and shows only the selected
 * panel's content.
 *
 * ProseMirror renders every child `tab` node view into this node's
 * `contentDOM` regardless of which one is "selected" — node views have no
 * built-in way to hide a child from the document flow, and `tabs`/`tab` are
 * still fully editable (unlike `admonition`, this container has no spare
 * attribute to stash the active index on: adding one would mean the PM doc
 * itself changes whenever a user merely *looks* at a different tab, and
 * would need a matching attr on the pure adapter schema for no round-trip
 * benefit). So which tab is active lives in `tabsActiveStore` (see that
 * module's doc comment for why — `TabsView` and each `TabView` mount as
 * separate React roots with no Context between them) rather than in this
 * component's own React state, read here via `useSyncExternalStore` so a
 * header click re-renders both this header row AND every sibling `TabView`.

  // was active, the store keeps pointing past the end until something writes
  // the clamped value back, which otherwise leaves every `TabView` computing
  // "not me" and the whole body blank even though a header shows selected.
  // Write the clamp back here so the store — and therefore every subscribed
  // `TabView` — agrees with the header row. Guarded to only fire when
  // actually out of range so it can't loop (`setActiveTabIndex` itself is
